# Logic

Logic is the systematic study of the general structures of sound reasoning and valid arguments;
the study of the methods and principles used for right reasoning. The proper study of logic will
enable the student to reason well and to pay due attention to the analysis of fallacies and natural
mistakes in reasoning. The study of logic gives the students techniques and methods for testing
the correctness of different kinds of reasoning. Logic will provide us with criteria to correct
reasoning with which we can test arguments for their correctness. Systematic study of arguments
has its origins in several ancient civilizations in ancient India, China and Greece. In the
development of Western logic we see Aristotle systematizing it as examining the general forms
of arguments with distinguishing them between valid and invalid. This course on Logic deals
with all the aspects of classical and modern logic as found in the Western tradition.

**Block 1** gives a brief picture of the concerns of the traditional and classical logic as it emerged
from the Aristotelian period onwards. The basic understanding of terms, propositions and
syllogisms with figures and moods enables the students of philosophy to dwell in the realm of
right reasoning and validity and invalidity of argumentation.

**Block 2** is concerned with the sentential Logic as in the Modern Logic. It brings home to the
students the importance of argument forms in Modern Logic as it is clear that arguments are
different from argument forms.

**Block 3** brings home to the students the methods of proving validity of an argument using
different procedures and rules that are employed in sentential logic. The block elaborates on the
proving validity using rules of inference in the first unit. In the next, attempt is made to give an
idea about conditional proof, by giving definition, importance, and principles of this method. We
then proceed to have an essential understanding of Indirect Proof and the principles used in this
method. Finally, an idea about proving invalidity is given.

**Block 4** is dedicated for Predicate Logic dealing with Quantifiers, Rules of Instantiation and
Generalization, Proof of validity and Proving Invalidity. It deals with the basic understanding of
predicate logic with the usage of quantifiers to symbolize the proposition. By doing so the
students would be able to progress their reasoning aptitude by identifying the internal structure of
the proposition. The proof of validity and proving the invalidity in predicate logic are well
covered in this block. Finally, the application part of symbolic lo
