# Block 1

Logic as a tool for distinguishing between the true and the false, as said by Averroes,
examines the general forms which arguments may take, which forms are valid, and
which are invalid. An argument is made up of a certain number of propositions. And a
proposition is made up of obviously of a certain number of words. So we have to start
our analysis of the formal structure of an argument by an analysis of the smallest unit
of an argument, ‘term’ and proceed to examine ‘propositions,’ and structure of
arguments.
By ‘inference’ is meant that operation of reason by which from some known truth we
arrive at another truth. Everyday experience teaches us that it is the way man learns
and that is the way man argues for or against his beliefs and convictions. In mediate
inference, deduction and induction are used very well. Deduction is when from a
more general truth one arrives at a more particular fact. Induction is when from
particular facts one arrives at a general truth. Logically speaking ‘deduction’ and
‘induction’ differ considerably. Study of different kinds of syllogisms is so crucial for
finding the validity of an argument.

**Unit 1** introduces the students to the basics of categorical propositions. This unit has
introduced us to terms, propositions, categorical propositions and Aristotle’s square of
oppositions.

**Unit 2** dwells on the central discussion of Logic, namely inference. Reasoning in a
right way is the focal point of Logic. Explaining the significance of inference in logic
and in life, the unit introduces the students to the basics of categorical syllogism,
along with various kinds of syllogisms.

**Unit 3** deals with figures, mood and types of syllogisms. The epistemological
assumptions of inference by the ‘figure’ of a syllogism is meant that kind of syllogism
which is determined by the function the ‘middle term’ plays in the syllogism. By the
‘mood’ of a syllogism is meant that kind of a syllogism which is determined by the
‘quantity’ and ‘quality’ of the three propositions.

**Unit 4** helps the students to understand the validity of syllogisms and thus sharpen the
process of inference. As Logic is concerned with the validity of an argumentation this
unit provides tools and different methods to point out the invalid syllogisms giving
adequate arguments.
